### How It's Made:
Tech used: Vue JS, SCSS.

I have finally put my VUE JS skills into practice with this app. I enjoyed building components and then finally bringing them together to build the app. Styling is done using SCSS which gives so many added features when compared to just CSS, like, nesting, mixins, functions etc.
